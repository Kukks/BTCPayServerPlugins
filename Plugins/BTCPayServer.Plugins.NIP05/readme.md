* On a store you have owner access to, click on the new "NIP05" side navigation menu item
* Specify a name and public key.
NOTE: You will not be able to select the same name across different stores. The public key is in hex format and not `npub...`
* Optionally include a set of relays that you primarily use so that client can discover your events more easily.

* Alternatively, you can import this data by using one of the Nostr browser extensions such as Alby or Nos2x 


Your NIP5 handle will be `name@yourbtcpayserver.domain`. If you have multiple domains mapped to the same btcpayserver, they will all be valid.
